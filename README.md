##  Malaria Diagnosis ML App
A Streamlit app that uses Machine Learning model to classify objects from images. Made by Athulya Saravanakumar. 

## About
Globally, billions of people own smartphones, which means that ML apps can help diagnose and treat large numbers of people!

Infecting over 200 million people every year, malaria kills more than 200,000 children, making it one of the world's most deadly diseases. Using this app, we can help fight malaria, one of the world's most deadly diseases. With this tool, healthcare workers in rural or developing areas can diagnose malaria without expensive laboratory equipment. We will use computer vision to detect malaria parasites in blood cells uploaded under a microscope by healthcare workers.

## Installation
